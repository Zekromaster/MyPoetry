Must I to thee goodbye now truly bid? 
But wait, for touch of thine still I do long, 
could that embrace we had at thy house door
have been the last I got from thee, indeed?
Explain to me, I beg, what one then doth
when they a love they never haved mourn,
for lack of will and charme, or fear of scorn,
hath stole from them the chance to come forth?
