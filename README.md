# My Poetry

I collected my poetry through Github. It's my first experiment in using Github for non-code projects, mostly for versioning.
Suggestions are welcome, although I consider myself, in the end, the sole owner of this poems and thus the holder of the last word on any edit.

## Regarding the LICENSE
The GNU GPL V3, which normally applies to Software, can be applied to any work for which a "Source Code" is discernible, defining "Source Code" as "The form of the work which is best for editing". In this case, we may consider the work to coincide with its source code, as the .txt files distributed through this repository are the _original_ form of the work itself.
